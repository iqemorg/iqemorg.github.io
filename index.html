            <h2>Quantum Electronics in Medicine</h2>
            <p><dfn id="quantum-electronics-def">Quantum electronics</dfn> refers to the study and application of electronic and photonic systems that leverage quantum mechanical principles. This includes the development of quantum-based devices such as lasers and LEDs, which use quantum effects—stimulated emission and electron-photon interactions—to generate and control light for non-invasive medical treatments and diagnostics.</p>
